## API doc generation

If an action has JSON schema validators, the schema file is converted to
Markdown format and published in the `apidoc` branch. Browse it at

[API doc tree](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-core/tree/apidoc)

Pull requests are assigned a dedicated branch. If the PR source branch is
`newfeature` the resulting documentation branch is `apidoc-newfeature`.
The branch lives as long as the PR is merged, or closed.
